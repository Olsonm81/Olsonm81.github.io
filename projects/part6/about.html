                    <p>Medical Care for the public and wildland firefighters including all the government employees on and off the fireline.  
                        We can respond in UTV's or 4x4 trucks, we will go wherever the need is.  They risk their lives for the communities, 
                        so they deserve no less from us. We strive to bring the best patient care and service on every contract.</p>
