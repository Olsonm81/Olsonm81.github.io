                    <p>We are a vast and hardworking team who gets the job done. We are currently comprised of 20 employees.
                        All of us combined have over 50 years of ongoing fire and medical experience. This company started with 
                        a goal of trying to make the difference in fire and medical across the Unitied States. So far our team have 
                        visitied 5 states and have been to some states multiple times! We enjoy knowing that we can make an 
                        impact in a local community by getting these government contracts to support local areas.
