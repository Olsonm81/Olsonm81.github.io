                <p>The first assignment was working to make a website using basic HTML code. For this website I made it about

                <p>For the third assignment I worked with flexboxes to make a copy of a picture of a website layout. This website

                <p>For the forth assignment we were tasked with created a remake of the universities graduate website. Not every detail

                <p>The fifth assignment had us make 3 columns on our website in html. Inside of each column is something that is made using
