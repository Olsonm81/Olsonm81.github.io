                <p>The first assignment was working to make a website using basic HTML code. For this website I made it about 
                    two National Parks which were Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Canyon.</p></a></div>

                <p>For the second assignment I worked with combining both HTML and CSS. For this website I made it about the pyramids

                <p>For the third assignment I worked with flexboxes to make a copy of a picture of a website layout. This website
                    would change depending on the screen size of the device viewing it.</p></a></div>
