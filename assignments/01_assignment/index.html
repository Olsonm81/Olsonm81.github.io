        <h1>America's T-28</h1>
        <h2>The T-28's purpose</h2>
        <p>This was one of the few American tanks that were constructed
            during WW2 that never saw any battles. It's purpose was to be
            used in the eastern front against the German Forces in trying
            to destory bunkers. During the development stages of the tank, 
            the Allied Forces had won in the eastern front causing this tank 
            to never be used in battle. It was supposed to be used later on during
            the conflcits with Japan, but they had surrended before it was put to use.

        <h2>Interesting facts about the T-28</h2>
        <p>This tank has some distint features that set it apart from 
            other American tanks that were produced during that time period.
            One of the features were the tracks on the tank. Unlike most tanks and 
            even modern ones today, the T-28 has a dual track. This could be useful 
            when going through tough terrain.
